## Data Visualization in pandas

Data visualization is one of the technique which provides option to easily understand the data and gives important insight about any data. In the previous section we have looked at how we can work with data in pandas. In this section we will look at some of the method which helps us to visualize those data. Even though there are some special and visualization specific libraries like `matplotlib`, `seaborn` etc. pandas visualization is a quick way of galancing the data. In fact pandas visualization is built on top of `matplotlib` as well.

Typically pandas visualization is used for basic plotting like line,histogram,scatter. It is recommended to use the other specilised tools for more detailed and cutomized visualizations. The advantage with pandas visulalization is that we can plot stright away from the DataFrame or the series. It is systatically very handy.

Lets get into visualization. As like in our pevious `pandas-operation` tutorial we are not going to create our own data set. We are going to use the very famous [iris dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). The reason to use this data set is that it is real data set and we can understand how visualization helps to understand any dataset. We are going to load it from seaborn(internet required).


```python
#loading the data set from seaborn
import seaborn as sns
iris = sns.load_dataset('iris')
```

This data set is about 3 flowers and the features we have are the lenght and width of both the patel and sepal of the flowers. Lets look at some records.


```python
print(iris.head())
```

Now, lets use the info() method which we saw in the previous setion to get some understanding about the data set. 


```python
iris.info()
```

It says that we have 150 records, 5 columns in that 4 of them are floats and 1 as object and it does not have any null values.


```python
import pandas as pd 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt                 # using pandas DV with matplotlib provides extra grapical effects.  
```

`plot`: In pandas all the different plots can be accessed from a single method plot. In the below example we will plot a line using the `line()` function in `plot`. 


```python
iris.plot.line()
```

As we discussed sytactically using pandas for visualization is very handy. `DataFrame/series.plot.<type of the plot>`


```python
#plotting based on series:

iris['sepal_length'].plot.line()
```

Pandas take all the matplotlib argument as part of keyword arguments. Lets change the size of the figure using the `figsize` argument in matplotlib.


```python
iris.plot.line(figsize = (12,4))
```

`hist()` : hist fuction is used to plot histograms. It takes the regular argument bin size as well. 


```python
iris.plot.hist()
```

<img src="https://github.com/harikrishnand/freecodecamp_images/blob/master/DF_hist.png" width="400" height="300" />


```python
iris.plot.hist(bins=20,figsize=(8,4),alpha = .7)     #alpha argument is used for transparency
```

<img src="https://github.com/harikrishnand/freecodecamp_images/blob/master/hist_alpha.png" width="400" height="300" />

`scatter`: scatter is another type of plot which can give us releation between different features. It takes 2 important argument x,y as column names.


```python
iris.plot.scatter(x='sepal_length',y='petal_length')
```

<img src="https://github.com/harikrishnand/freecodecamp_images/blob/master/DF_scatter.png" width="400" height="300" />

`scatter` takes a 3rd variable in c argument and plots the color ratio as per the value. 


```python
iris.plot.scatter(x='sepal_length',y='sepal_width',c='petal_length')
```

<img src="https://github.com/harikrishnand/freecodecamp_images/blob/master/DF_scatter_c.png" width="400" height="300" />

`scatter` can take the 3rd variable in the form of size as well but it must be a series not a column. Example below:


```python
iris.plot.scatter(x='sepal_length',y='sepal_width',s=iris['petal_length']*15)
```

<img src="https://github.com/harikrishnand/freecodecamp_images/blob/master/DF_scatter_s.png" width="400" height="300" />

`plot()` : plot is a pandas method which allows all the above plots to be plot from a single place. It has a argument `kind` which takes the type of the plot like line/hist/scatter etc.


```python
iris.plot(kind='line',figsize=(12,4))
```
